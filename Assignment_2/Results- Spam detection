Read .txt file, read contents, ham = 0 and spam = 1 as labels

Converted text to lowercase

Features obtained using count-vectorizer

1) Naive Bayes model trained, accuracy = 98.65%, ROC curve and confusion matrix show a good performance

2) SVM model trained, accuracy = 85.5%, confusion matrix shows that the model always predicts 0 so the count vectorizer features are not sufficient with this approach
