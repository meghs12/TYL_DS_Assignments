Dataset = CIFAR-10 (10 class problem, 0% baseline accuracy)

Normalized pixel values, flattented 3D to 1D

1) KNN Classifier- tuned to find k = 12
   Obtained accuracy = 34.28% (baseline accuracy = 10%), confusion matrix determines a moderate performance
   
2) Decision Tree Classifier
   Obtained accuracy = 10% (baseline accuracy = 10%), the classifier is just choosing randomly and isn't performing well
