Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?resource=download

33 features, 569 data points

Feature 'Unnamed: 32' was empty and thus discarded. None of the other columns had null values

The target variable 'diagnosis' was transformed into numerical format- 1 for M (Malignant) and 0 for B (Benign)

80-20 train test split was performed to get 465 training points and 114 test points

1) Linear regression model trained. As the model is regression based and the task is classification based, the predictions were rounded to be either 0 or 1. 
   The top five important features were 'radius_worst', 'radius_mean', 'perimeter_mean', 'area_worst' and 'perimeter_worst' 
   Obtained accuracy of 95.61% and the ROC curve and confusion matrix show a good prediction performance

2) Logistic regression model trained. Obtained accuracy of 97.36% and the ROC curve and confusion matrix show a good prediction performance
   False positive rate for logistic regression was lower than that of linear regression.
